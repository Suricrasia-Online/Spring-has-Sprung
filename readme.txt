Spring Has Sprung - 512b exe gfx for ubuntu linux - blackle / Suricrasia Online

Requires libclutter-1.0/libgobject-2.0, python3, gzip

All of these are installed by default on ubuntu. For mac you must install libclutter with homebrew. The mac version will report a gzip error. This is normal, as in order to make it 512 bytes I had to remove one of the checksum bytes off the end of the gzipped payload!
